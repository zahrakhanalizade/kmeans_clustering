## K Means
In this project, I implement a K-Means clustering algorithm and run in on MNIST dataset.
There are 4 functions to implement total: 3 in [`k_means.py`](./k_means.py) and 1 in [`main.py`](./main.py).
`calculate_centers` and `cluster_data` and `lloyd_algorithm` in [`k_means.py`]
And the `main` function in `main.py` file.

Code is optimized to avoid the usual long runtime.
